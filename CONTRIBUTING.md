Thanks for contributing!

## Dev setup
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Code style
- Keep the single-file CLI simple and dependency-light.
- Prefer clear, defensive error messages for API failures.

## Testing
- Consider running against a small test org or a subset of projects first.
- Avoid committing secrets; use environment variables or GitHub Actions secrets.
